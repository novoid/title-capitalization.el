* title-capitalization.el --- Proper English title capitalization of a marked region

This Emacs package provides the function ~title-capitalization~. In
case you selected a region (usually a heading/title), this function
does capitalize the words according to general English rules.

For details, please do read my blog entry on
http://karl-voit.at/2015/05/25/elisp-title-capitalization/

** Why

It is wasted brain energy to do the task by yourself.

** Usage

Mark the line of your title and invoke: ~title-capitalization~

I have mapped it to ~C-c C-, c~ via:

: (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-,") 'my-map) ;; my personal prefix/map
: (define-key my-map "c" 'title-capitalization)

** Bonus: Your Own List of Exceptions

You can define a variable containing a list with exceptions. For
example, if you want to have "[[https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg][lazyblorg]]" and "[[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]]" not capitalized in
headings, use following snippet:

: ;; additionally to the list defined in title-capitalization:
: (defvar my-do-not-capitalize-words '("lazyblorg" "mutt")
:   "My personal list of words that doesn't get capitalized in titles.")

* Contributions

I got the idea for this code from [[http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=titlecaps][a script by Doug Adams]].

The code contains valuable and major contributions from David Mann,
Barry Fishman, Santiago Mejia, Julien Chastang, and others from the 
Emacs development mailinglist.
